* Why do we design beego?

1. I want to create a framework while I am writing this book.

2. It is inspired by tornado, sinatra and flask.


* What can beego do?

beego is a http application framework

Why it's called http framework other than web framework?

The reason is beego suit for any kinds of http service: api service, web backend, game development etc.

* beego's Key Features

- Tons of products. 360，weico，jd，opera ...
- RESTful model with customizable actions
- high stability, frequent update, continuous maintainace
- Good documents, online F&Q

* Where will beego go?

- Highly modular. Improve existent modules and develop more new modules
- Light core framework. beego is formed by modules now. Will make it even lighter. Any part of MVC can be replaced.
- Enhance routing, compating with other framework's service. For example you can create a module in Martini and call it in beego.
- Enhance bee tool. Automate the development even more.
